# ip-client

## Intended use

This is client is intended to be executed as a cron job on a device will running 24/7. The run interval would be based on the requirements of the target server/site. For example, for low traffic sites, the client could run every 30 minutes. For high traffic sites, the client could run every 5 minutes. This could be beneficial for those sites that run on hosting that meters resources.

## Warning

This is the first iteration of the client and so it is not very robust. In its current state it is not recommended in production. However it can be used with the other related scripts in a test environment first.
